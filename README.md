For now I am putting my TiddlyWiki related projects on hold because I need to make money. If you want me to do something with one of my projects, feel free to leave a donation and I will attempt to put that amount of time into whatever project you specify, or whichever one is currently needing my attention if you don't specify. Feel free to link to a specific PR or Issue if you like as well. 

You can donate via PayPal at http://paypal.me/Arlen22
